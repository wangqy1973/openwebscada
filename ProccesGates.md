# Introduction #

In all SCADA applications we have GATES subject for definition of dynamic data.
In this project GATES are all dynamics data too.


# Details #

Gates examples:
  * input value from measurement device
  * arythmethic calculations with mixed gates (inputs values, consts, etc)
  * consts values for proccess calculation

Gates names example:
  * G\_INP\_01\_TEST = (dynamic data form proccess)
  * G\_CONST\_01\_TMP\_VALUE = 1.5
  * G\_OUT\_01\_TEST\_WITH\_CONST\_MLTPL = ( ( G\_INP\_01\_TEST
