## Materials ##


EtherCAT

EtherCAT (Ethernet for Control Automation Technology) is the Ethernet solution for industrial automation, characterised by outstanding performance and particularly simple handling.



Ethernet

Ethernet is the dominant standard in the office world. The advantages of Ethernet, such as high data transmission rates, easy methods of integration into existing networks, and a wide range of services and interfaces are also found in the Beckhoff Ethernet products.



Lightbus

This well proven fibre optics bus system from Beckhoff is characterised by particularly good immunity to EMI, easy installation and a very fast, cyclic and deterministic data flow.



PROFIBUS

PROFIBUS is widely used as a fast bus for decentralised peripheral components (PROFIBUS DP). In addition to PROFIBUS DP and FMS, Beckhoff also supports the standard for drive communication, PROFIBUS MC.



PROFINET

PROFINET is the open Industrial Ethernet standard of the PNO (PROFIBUS users organisation). Internationally established IT standards such as TCP/IP are used for communication.



EtherNet/IP

Ethernet/IP is the Industrial Ethernet standard of the ODVA (Open DeviceNet Vendor Association). Ethernet/IP is based on Ethernet TCP/IP and UDP/IP.



CANopen

The effective utilisation of the bus bandwidth allows CANopen to achieve a short system reaction time at comparatively low data rates. The typical advantages of CAN, such as high data security and multi-master capability are retained.



DeviceNet

DeviceNet is a sensor/actuator bus system that originated in the USA, but which meanwhile is increasingly being used in Europe and Asia. DeviceNet is CAN based (Controller Area Net).



Interbus

Interbus is easy to configure, fast and reliable. The shift register protocol of the master/slave system offers high efficiency in cyclic communication.



SERCOS interface

SERCOS was originally developed as a fast fibre optic bus system for drives. Thanks to the Beckhoff SERCOS Bus Coupler, the advantages such as high data rate and short cycle times can now be provided for the I/O peripherals too.



ControlNet

ControlNet is an open, standardised fieldbus system. The protocol allows both cyclic and acyclic data to be exchanged over the bus without affecting each other.



CC-Link

CC-Link (Control & Communication Link) is an open bus system for communication between the control and fieldbus level. It is predominately used in Asia.



Fipio

FIP complies with the European standard EN 50170 and receives manufacturer-independent support from the WorldFIP organisation. Through periodic and aperiodic exchange of variables and messages, the performance of the bus can be adjusted to the application.



USB

USB has grown into a standard interface for PC technology. Thanks to its high transmission rate, flexible topology through integrated hubs and the Beckhoff USB Bus Coupler, this system can be used as a substitute for a fieldbus when distances are small.



Modbus

Modbus is an open, serial communications protocol based on the master/slave architecture. Since it is extremely easy to implement on all kinds of serial interfaces, it has gained wide acceptance.



RS232/RS485

The “classic” serial interfaces, RS232 and RS485, continue in wide use. The Beckhoff RS485/RS232 I/O modules use a simple, published serial communication protocol that is easy to implement.



AS-Interface

AS-Interface connects sensors and actuators with the higher control level via a simple and low-priced wiring method. AS-Interface is internationally standardised through EN 50295 and IEC 62026-2.



IO-Link

IO-Link serves to connect sensors and actuators to the control level by means of an inexpensive point-to-point connection. As an open interface, IO-Link can be integrated in all common fieldbus systems.



DALI

The “Digital Addressable Lighting Interface” is a building automation standard for the digital control of electronic ballasts. DALI is used as a subsystem, e.g. for controlling lighting, blinds or temperature, and can communicate directly with the building management system.



EIB

EIB (European Installation Bus) is widely and mainly used in Europe as a bus system for cabling in buildings.



LON

LON (Local Operating Network) is a multi-network-capable communication system for distributed applications. It is predominately used for automation applications in commercial buildings.
